# N-gram Filtering and Analysis Application

An interactive web application for complex filtering and analysis of syntactic n-grams. Built with Streamlit and powered by a PostgreSQL database, this tool allows linguists and researchers to dynamically construct queries, identify linguistic patterns, and perform frequency analysis.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Filtering:** Create multi-level filtering rules based on phrase length and characteristics of each word (token, lemma, part of speech, tag, syntactic dependency, morphology).
- **Pattern Moderation:** A built-in system for users to review, rate, and comment on linguistic patterns.
- **User Management:** An admin panel for managing user access and roles.
- **Save and Load:** Ability to save and load entire filter sets and individual rule blocks for reuse.
- **SQL Query View:** The application displays the generated SQL query, ensuring transparency and aiding in debugging.
- **Results Analysis:** Perform frequency analysis of words by position in the filtered phrases.
- **Performance Caching:** Repeated database queries are cached to ensure a fast user experience.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Streamlit
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Key Python Libraries:** `psycopg2-binary`, `streamlit-cookies-manager`, `bcrypt`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A running PostgreSQL server.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd patterns_filtration
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the app directory
    cd ngrams_app
    # Install required packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    - In the `ngrams_app/` directory, create a file named `.env`.
    - Add your database connection details to this file. This file is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be tracked by Git.
      ```env
      DB_HOST=your_db_host
      DB_PORT=5432
      DB_NAME=ngrams_2_0
      DB_USER=your_db_user
      DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
      ```

4.  **Database Schema:**
    - Ensure your PostgreSQL database is created and populated.
    - The application requires several tables: `ngrams`, `users`, `unique_patterns`, `moderation_patterns`, `pattern_examples`, `saved_filters`, and `saved_blocks`.
    - For a detailed schema, please refer to the `app_documentation.md` file.

### Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the application directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ngrams_app
    ```
2.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run Home.py
    ```
    The application will open in your default web browser.
